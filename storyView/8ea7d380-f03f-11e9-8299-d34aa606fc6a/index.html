These workshops were distributed among 3 campuses of the institution; Main campus at Mirella (3 workshops), Las Marias (2 workshops) and Betania (3 workshops).</p>

        <h3 class="sjrk-st-block-heading-view"><p>Workshop Dynamics</p>
</h3>
        <div class="sjrk-st-block-text-view"><p>The approach to the workshops was the same in each case, while each took a unique shape depending on the skills and interests of the group.</p>
<p>First we started with a group presentation in which we shared our name, age, interests and dreams, then, under the inspiration of the projects we talked about the importance of communications and art in the world in which we find ourselves, and how web tools can open doors to embarking on the path of our future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6D226g7v8"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/iR6D226g7v8/0.jpg" alt="STOP MOTION"></a></p>
<p>The students were asked to write answers to the following questions on a sheet: Who I am? Where do I come from? Where am I going and what is my purpose? The idea was to answer these questions through a video made with the tools provided. The videos were to be posted on the platform under the name of Time Capsule, a project that aims to reinforce the vision that will allow children to develop in all areas of their lives, narrate their experiences, and plan for their future.</p>
<p>Secondly, I shared about my work in The Chronicles of Juana, focusing on the strengths of mobile devices that we usually have at hand and with which we can do almost anything in creative and audiovisual terms.</p>
<p>Within the framework of these products, key issues arose at all stages of production such as: camera management and the importance of curiosity as the basis for a good photograph, types of plane and angles, interview techniques, body expression and linguistics, the use of music, image rights and authorship, editing work, and others.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it was not possible to explore all of these issues fully during the course of the 2-hour workshops, given the universe of details that make up a visual work. However, the students were left with a seed which can be germinated to help them find the best way to use the tools to meet their learning and creating needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XnYqeYHwu0"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/4XnYqeYHwu0/0.jpg" alt="STOP MOTION"></a></p>
<p>In one exercise we used StopMotion, which provides a simple and efficient technique of creation, to make a group animation. This allowed the students to see the ease with which they can carry out our creative ideas, and to live the experience of the world that moves behind the content they are receiving all the time through social networks. In this way they began to understand that they have everything they need to also be content generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlQTm2HFZw"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/HrlQTm2HFZw/0.jpg" alt="STOP MOTION"></a></p>
<p>To close the workshop, they shared about creative tools such as FilmoraGo cell phone, MyMovie, Memes Creator, Gift Creator and DuRecorder, with which they have infinite possibilities to let their imagination fly.</p>

</h3>
        <div class="sjrk-st-block-text-view"><p>On Thursday, May 16, I visited the main campus where I was kindly received at 8:00 am by Professor Giovanna. The first workshop was developed with the 9th grade students, and was based on my experience as a social communicator and journalist, and with the idea of strengthening and reinforcing the student’s creative skills in order to implement them within the framework of a real newscast. The workshop ended at 10:00 am. The second workshop ran from 10:15 am to 12:30 pm with the 8th grade students, and the closing workshop was held with grades 10 and 11 students between 1:00 and 3:30 pm.</p>

<p>Talents and strengths were identified among some of the students, who expressed interest in the path of communications (mostly YouTubers) as a latent possibility and need for their near futures.</p>

</h3>
        <div class="sjrk-st-block-text-view"><p>After a couple of hours in a jeep ride on an uncovered and rainy road, we arrived around 8:00 am at Las Marías School, where Professor Byron was waiting for us, and led us to a class of 9th grade boys who rose kindly before my arrival as a sign of greeting and respect. The workshop was held until 10:00 am, when the 8th grade boys arrived and with whom we continued until 12:00 pm.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tgHtkV7vdI"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/-tgHtkV7vdI/0.jpg" alt="STOP MOTION"></a></p>
<p>I can say that the experience with these boys was one of the most inspiring, because their curiosity and willingness allowed the work to flow, such that with a couple of extra hours of meeting in the afternoon we were able to make a short film called "Freckles" with everyone's collaboration.</p>

</h3>
        <div class="sjrk-st-block-text-view"><p>A sunny day awaited us on the Betania sidewalk, and the workshops with the 8th, 9th and 11th grades were efficiently developed thanks to the collaboration of the boys and especially of Professor Ruth and her daughter, who were kindly active and attentive from the reception to the end of the workshops.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx01EvbhYew"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/hx01EvbhYew/0.jpg" alt="STOP MOTION"></a></p>
<p>It was a busy day - together with the boys we applied what they learned and in the afternoon we carried out an activity to recover the historical memory of the district. About 25 boys stayed to give continuity to the process; they held interviews, filmed the spaces, photographed curiosities and in this way explored and applied their new skills.</p>
